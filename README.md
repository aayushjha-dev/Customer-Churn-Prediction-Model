# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model
• Created an artificial neural network using TensorFlow and Sklearn libraries to predict whether individual customers
of a bank will leave or stay based on geo-demographical and transactional data.
• Utilized a dataset from UCI machine learning repository containing customer details such as credit score, age,
balance, and account activity to engineer features and enhance model accuracy.
